# Java Standard Edition v17 Path

First, you will learn about the fundamental concepts and language constructs of the Java language, including object-orientation (OO). Then you will move on to more specific, in-depth coverage of Java 17 and topics that a Java developer will use on a day-to-day basis, including error handling, working with lists and generics, accessing data and working asynchronously. This path also covers fundamentals such as Unit Testing and QA using Java. With these topics understood, you will be able to create and maintain Java applications in your organization.

Finally, with most code-constructs known, you can learn more about best practices to create your next Java application. You’ll learn how to apply SOLID principles, design patterns and how to refactor existing Java code.

After completing this path, you’ll be able to apply this knowledge to create all types of Java projects.
